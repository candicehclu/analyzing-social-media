"I totally get the concern ‚Äî no one wants to see government funds wasted. But sometimes we end up voting or speaking out against our own best interests based on a sound bite, without fully understanding the long-term impact. Take Harvard, for example ‚Äî it's easy to overlook how much everyday life has been shaped by research from institutions like that. From advancements in anesthesia to breakthroughs in disease eradication, Harvard‚Äôs work has helped protect public health and improve global quality of life. These aren‚Äôt abstract benefits ‚Äî they touch *our* lives and the lives of people we care about. So it's worth asking: are we criticizing institutions that actually serve us, just because we haven‚Äôt been shown the full picture?

"Donald Trump, the criminal president Donald Trump of the United States, allied with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele to justify the unjustifiable: the illegal expulsion of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran immigrant who was authorized to reside in the United States with his family. This expulsion, labeled an ""administrative error"" by the Trump administration, led to this man being imprisoned under inhumane conditions in El Salvador.
In a political maneuver, Trump spent $6 million to rent a detention camp, claiming to protect Americans from a threat he himself exaggerated. Exploiting the xenophobia of his supporters, he turned a common issue into an artificial crisis, diverting attention from his own scandals and criminal convictions.
Pathologically narcissistic and megalomaniacal, Trump conditioned his supporters to believe his lies, fostering a toxic cult of personality. His disdain for truth and justice is evident in this case. He should be held personally accountable for the suffering inflicted on Kilmar Abrego Garcia and his family, financing their return and compensating them for the harm caused.",0,2025-04-15T13:34:27Z
