"Maybe it is time to close Harvard for good and remove the ability of this school to harm America through teaching students  policies harming this country and providing knowledge in many subjects that is far below world’s average benchmarks. Sadly, it is Harvard that educated many policy makers who directed de-industrialization of America and led its decline over the last 20-30-40 years. Harvard’s destruction of American values and American economy started long before its current affection with antisemitism. It’s antisemitism may be one of many side effects of what Harvard is as institution. The question we need to ask ourselves is - do we need an institution that works against our country on our soil? Institution that fosters harmful long-term policies and grows “enemies from within” probably needs to treated as such and not given a free ride.",0,2025-04-16T08:41:38Z

"I totally get the concern — no one wants to see government funds wasted. But sometimes we end up voting or speaking out against our own best interests based on a sound bite, without fully understanding the long-term impact. Take Harvard, for example — it's easy to overlook how much everyday life has been shaped by research from institutions like that. From advancements in anesthesia to breakthroughs in disease eradication, Harvard’s work has helped protect public health and improve global quality of life. These aren’t abstract benefits — they touch *our* lives and the lives of people we care about. So it's worth asking: are we criticizing institutions that actually serve us, just because we haven’t been shown the full picture?

"Maybe talk about Sebastian Gorka.....who is a British-Hungarian-American political operative with ties to Hungary’s far-right and has served as a key advisor to Donald Trump. He previously advised Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and has promoted nationalist, anti-immigrant, and Islamophobic policies. Gorka became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2012 but lived in Hungary for years and maintains close ideological ties with Orbán's government. He is part of a broader effort to align U.S. right-wing politics with European far-right strategies. Hungarian government-backed think tanks like the Danube Institute and Századvég have partnered with U.S. conservative groups such as the Heritage Foundation to shape policy and political messaging. These efforts influence Trump’s approach to issues like immigration, family policy, and authoritarian governance. Gorka’s presence in Trump’s orbit reflects a dangerous international pipeline of far-right ideas that threaten democratic institutions and normalize authoritarian tactics.",2,2025-04-15T21:01:45Z
"The maker of Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep brands explained that it was taking “immediate actions” because of the president’s tariffs, which have hit the auto industry particularly hard.
Last week, company officials went into its three Kokomo plants searching for volunteers before forcing some workers with less seniority to be laid off temporarily, Butler said. For now, the layoffs last only two weeks but could be extended, as they have been in the past. For some 470 Stellantis workers placed on indefinite layoffs last year, these new layoffs could further delay their return to work and even force them out of the industry.
“It’s scary, and we don’t know if it’s going to stick,” Butler said of the latest round of layoffs, as a procession of autoworkers dropped in to ask him for assistance filing for unemployment benefits. “If these layoffs are related to the tariffs, it doesn’t appear that this problem is going to be fixed in two weeks.”
Stellantis’s April 3 announcement made it one of the first companies to specifically blame layoffs on the Trump tariffs.",0,2025-04-15T20:58:45Z

Public funding especially from taxpayer money allows universities like that to invest in projects that actually help people. These are things with real social impact. Without that kind of support they would have to cut those programs first because they are not profitable. And let’s be honest a university still has to earn money to keep running.

Social projects as impactful as they are usually do not grab the spotlight like tech projects do. Investments go to future driven stuff like self driving cars, artificial intelligence or manufacturing technology, because those promise big returns and sound exciting. But the important work like mental health access, rehab programs or educational equity often gets ignored.These are the things that really make a difference in people’s lives but they are not treated as a priority just because they do not bring in profit.",0,2025-04-15T20:31:23Z

Since having an ivy league degree gets you to a higher starting level than the rest of us. So after a few decades they had pushed out all conservative professors, they had graduated the next generations of leadership in private and public institutions, they had corrupted the teachers union making their indoctrination start at much younger ages.

All are accountable to the judgment of time

Most the time as a politician stands up
Along with the truth, their brain sits down.
Promising anything and everything to anyone
While posing to the public, to be on common ground.

Worrying about love ones, jobs, and the future
Infectious disease and paying next month’s bills.
Saving for our retirement and the unexpected
It's no wonder we drink, smoke, pray and pop pills.

This expulsion, labeled an ""administrative error"" by the Trump administration, led to this man being imprisoned under inhumane conditions in El Salvador.
In a political maneuver, Trump spent $6 million to rent a detention camp, claiming to protect Americans from a threat he himself exaggerated. Exploiting the xenophobia of his supporters, he turned a common issue into an artificial crisis, diverting attention from his own scandals and criminal convictions.
Pathologically narcissistic and megalomaniacal, Trump conditioned his supporters to believe his lies, fostering a toxic cult of personality. His disdain for truth and justice is evident in this case. He should be held personally accountable for the suffering inflicted on Kilmar Abrego Garcia and his family, financing their return and compensating them for the harm caused.",0,2025-04-15T13:34:27Z
