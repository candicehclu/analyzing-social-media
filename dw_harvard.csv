"As a retired researcher, If you take a closer look at the so-called ""groundbreaking"" research coming out of Harvard over the past decade, funded by nearly $90 billion in taxpayer money, you'll find a very different story than the one presented in press releases. None of these discoveries came out of Harvard in isolation. They‚Äôre all extensions, optimizations, or repackagings of work that has been underway globally for decades.

CRISPR? That‚Äôs built on a bacterial immune mechanism discovered in the late '80s, refined by researchers around the world. Harvard was one of many institutions involved, not the origin.

Prime editing? Just a more precise spin on CRISPR, which itself is part of a longer lineage of gene-editing tools.

Flow batteries? They‚Äôve been around for over 50 years. Harvard‚Äôs version is just a tweak in chemistry for better stability: not a new invention.

The truth is, academic research, especially at elite institutions is rarely the source of isolated breakthroughs. It's a web of collaboration, and Harvard often plays the role of amplifier rather than originator. It‚Äôs well-positioned to secure grants, license patents, and dominate headlines, but that doesn‚Äôt mean the work is fundamentally new.

And let‚Äôs be honest: the grant game incentivizes incrementalism, buzzwords, and safe bets with publishable results, not genuine risk or paradigm-shifting discovery. Institutions that thrive off massive federal grants often operate more like publicly subsidized private enterprises.. filtering taxpayer money through a prestige machine that spits out white papers, paywalled publications, and eventual commercialization for private gain.

Call it what it is: a polished, institutionalized pipeline where the public funds the research, but rarely sees the return.

Guess who pockets the money?",0,2025-04-18T16:13:55Z
