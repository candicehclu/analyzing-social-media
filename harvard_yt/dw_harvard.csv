"As a retired researcher, If you take a closer look at the so-called ""groundbreaking"" research coming out of Harvard over the past decade, funded by nearly $90 billion in taxpayer money, you'll find a very different story than the one presented in press releases. None of these discoveries came out of Harvard in isolation. They’re all extensions, optimizations, or repackagings of work that has been underway globally for decades.

CRISPR? That’s built on a bacterial immune mechanism discovered in the late '80s, refined by researchers around the world. Harvard was one of many institutions involved, not the origin.

Prime editing? Just a more precise spin on CRISPR, which itself is part of a longer lineage of gene-editing tools.

Flow batteries? They’ve been around for over 50 years. Harvard’s version is just a tweak in chemistry for better stability: not a new invention.

The truth is, academic research, especially at elite institutions is rarely the source of isolated breakthroughs. It's a web of collaboration, and Harvard often plays the role of amplifier rather than originator. It’s well-positioned to secure grants, license patents, and dominate headlines, but that doesn’t mean the work is fundamentally new.

And let’s be honest: the grant game incentivizes incrementalism, buzzwords, and safe bets with publishable results, not genuine risk or paradigm-shifting discovery. Institutions that thrive off massive federal grants often operate more like publicly subsidized private enterprises.. filtering taxpayer money through a prestige machine that spits out white papers, paywalled publications, and eventual commercialization for private gain.

Call it what it is: a polished, institutionalized pipeline where the public funds the research, but rarely sees the return.

Guess who pockets the money?",0,2025-04-18T16:13:55Z

To the ignorant commenters: Harvard can easily survive this by selling patents to the highest bidder. And making everything they produce patented. That would generate massive wealth for Harvard at the expense at the end users a.k.a patients. The idiocy....,17,2025-04-16T00:53:39Z

The cat’s out of the bag. This administration is authoritarian. Americans voted in this administration. The system is fixed to make Americans desperate and uneducated. The world can no longer trust the US to be a logical or stable actor so long as those conditions persist… and they will persist for the foreseeable future. Americans will be the biggest losers of this debacle. Your strength was in your economic and military partnerships with key global players. You will have neither moving forward and will likely fall into civil unrest. The American century is over.,0,2025-04-15T23:47:16Z
