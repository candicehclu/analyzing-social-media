"How does a University have Constitutional Rights? There is only one constitutional right enumerated in the U.S. Constitution for U.S. Citizens, the others are protections against violating an individual's inalienable rights. So, how does a University become an ""individual"" under the Constitution and gain standing to have those Constitutional protections? And, ""Democracy""? The founders, and James Madison, took very careful steps to safeguard the U.S. from becoming a Democracy. The word itself does not appear in the U.S. Constitution, and for good reason. If you read about the Constitutional Convention and the intent of the authors of the Constitution, you may see that Trump is attempting to fix what has happened to the U.S. Unfortunately, I don't think there is a way to fix what has happened to the U.S.  It's too far gone, given that politicians and the media keep referring to the U.S. as a Democracy or a ""Free Democracy.""

Steele report: Russian operatives gathered damaging video evidence of perverted sex acts of presidential candidate in 2013, for blackmail. Mueller said “There were multiple, systematic efforts to interfere in our election.” Trump campaign had more than 140 contacts with Russian operatives, and Trump attempted to obstruct justice at least ten times. Campaign chair lied about then finally admitted to sharing info with Russian spy. Trump, ignoring US intelligence said: “…Putin, he just said it wasn’t Russia. I will say this, I don’t see any reason why it would be.” Secret meeting in Trump Tower with Russkies. Jared attempts to set up secret back channel to Russia in the Russian embassy. Trump to NATO member on prospect of Russian attack on their country “In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want.” Trump: “If Putin likes Donald Trump… That’s called an asset…” Yeah, a Russian asset. FBI chief Kash Patel was paid $25,000 to appear in anti-FBI video by Russian backers. “The love in the air, I’ve never seen anything like it” Trump said of January 6 rioters, some of them cop-killers… “Russia if you’re listening…” “I think you will probably be rewarded mightily…” Yes, they own a seditious, treasonous felonious American president. Where do you think all those top secret docs in the bathroom ended up? Anonymous says they have evidence the election was hacked for Trump, using Starlink...

The gender madness too stupid to react to;
Anti semitism organised by local mosques...

The state pays taxpayers money; so they have the right to put demands.
One of the demands should be: only state money when the institute does NOT have capital of themselves.

The university should not allow demonstrations on their grounds at all; there is a political sytem called voting.
And most certainly no demonstrations organized by foreigners (muslims).

"ДЛЯ СКЛЕРОТИКОВ, НЕ ПОМНЯЩИХ УРОКОВ ИСТОРИИ!
20 апреля 1942 года завершилась Битва за Москву, в ходе которой впервые с начала Второй мировой войны Третий рейх потерпел стратегическое поражение.

С 22 июня 1941 года немецкая армия стремительно продвигалась вглубь СССР.
Цель Гитлера - молниеносно разгромить Красную Армию и захватить Москву до наступления зимы. Он считал: падёт Москва - падёт СССР.

К началу Московской битвы немцы захватили Прибалтику, Белоруссию, Молдавию, значительную часть Украины, блокировали Ленинград.
К концу сентября немецкая армия стояла на подступах к столице.
Операция по захвату города получила название ""Тайфун"".

Битва за Москву шла с 30 сентября 1941-го по 20 апреля 1942 года - почти 7 месяцев, и состояла из периодов:
➤ оборонительный - с 30 сентября по 5 декабря 1941 года;
➤ наступательный, состоит из этапов:
●  контрнаступление советских войск - с 5 декабря 1941-го по 7 января 1942-го;
●  наступления советских войск - с 7 января по 20 апреля 1942 года.

В Битве за Москву участвовали войска Западного, Калининского, Резервного, Брянского, левого крыла Северо-Западного фронта и правого крыла Юго-Западного фронта, войска ПВО и ВВС.

В начале операции обстановка была не в пользу Красной Армии.
Ситуация была критическая, и 15 октября было принято решение об эвакуации Москвы - немцы стояли в 30 км от столицы.

К началу зимы благодаря упорному сопротивлению наступление врага было остановлено. Немецкая армия выдохлась, исчерпала резервы, начала испытывать  дефицит горючего, к тому же серьёзным испытанием стали морозы.

5 декабря Красная Армия перешла в контрнаступление. Этот день является одним из дней воинской славы России.

8 декабря Гитлер был вынужден подписать директиву № 39 о переходе немецких войск к обороне на всём советско-германском фронте.

Особую роль в Битве за Москву сыграли дивизии, переброшенные с Дальнего Востока - свежие, обученные, экипированные к зиме. Их прибытие стало возможным после разведданных Рихарда Зорге - о том что Япония не нападёт на СССР в ближайшее время.

К апрелю враг был отброшен на запад на 150-400 км, что окончательно сняло угрозу столице.
Это было первое крупное поражение Германии в войне - блицкриг сорван, вера в непобедимость вермахта разрушена, Гитлер был вынужден вести затяжную войну.

Harvard has over 53 billion in endowments. Why on Earth should they expect billions from taxpayers  ?,0,2025-04-19T13:59:23Z

Trump declaring war on Harvard pocketbook

President Trump is going after the fat pocketbooks of Harvard, PBS and other elitist institutions in a deliberate strategy to get them to bend to his administration’s positions.

It’s an effort on Trump’s part to hit his opponents where it hurts the most — right in the wallet. That’s where it breaks them.

Harvard’s $52 billion endowment makes it the richest university in the world, and Trump’s attempt to revoke the university’s tax exempt status would be a severe blow to its ability to raise funds and attract top notch students and faculty.

Trump is also now escalating the fight, demanding to know Harvard’s source of foreign funds. Can the school withstand the disinfectant of sunlight?

“Tax exempt status, I mean, it’s a privilege, it’s really a privilege,” Trump said this week. “And it’s been abused by a lot more than Harvard. It’s something that these schools really have to be very, very careful with.”

It’s a question many Americans may now be asking: Why should Harvard and other Ivy League schools be tax exempt?

They don’t provide a service to the average person. The average person’s kids can’t go to Harvard. The school is the very definition of elitism.

Yet Harvard has decided to take Trump on, refusing to yield to the president’s demands after Trump froze $2.2 billion in funding.

Who’s their consultant, Claudine Gay?

Trump is not legally allowed to force the IRS to revoke tax exempt status, but the IRS claims it launched its own investigation into the matter before Trump made it a priority. The law says if you’re a tax exempt organization you can’t take political positions — a strict limitation that Harvard and others may be violating.

While calling Harvard a “disgrace” and “obviously antisemitic,” Trump said there had been no final decision on making the university lose its tax status. But the president is not stopping at Harvard. The Trump administration is withholding millions in federal funds to Maine to get the state to change its policy on allowing transgender athletes to compete against girls and women.

Trump is also employing the pocketbook strategy to punish public media like PBS — pulling back federal funds because of their liberal bias.

It’s a battle of populism vs. elitism, and one that Trump hopes to have the public on his side.

Locally, tax exempt Harvard is consistently dragging its feet to make payments in lieu of taxes to the city of Boston, a battle every mayor has had to engage in in recent years.

If the IRS revokes the tax exempt status of Harvard and other universities it could have a major impact on the city’s efforts to collect payments.

"Harvard is known for discriminating Asian Americans in favor of  blacks. 

""The lawsuit, Students for Fair Admissions (SFFA) v. Harvard, alleges that Harvard's admissions process discriminates against Asian American applicants by using subjective personality ratings and other factors to lower their overall scores. While Harvard has denied the claims, the lawsuit has highlighted concerns about the use of race-conscious admissions policies and their potential impact on different racial groups. The Supreme Court's decision in June 2023, which struck down race-conscious admissions policies, has further complicated the debate. ""

SFFA sued Harvard in 2013, alleging that the university's admissions practices violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by discriminating against Asian Americans. The lawsuit claims that Harvard uses subjective factors, such as personality and likability, to unfairly penalize Asian American applicants, resulting in lower overall scores. 
Harvard's Defense:

Harvard has consistently denied these allegations, arguing that its admissions process is comprehensive and considers multiple factors, not just race. The university has also pointed to the fact that the percentage of Asian Americans admitted to Harvard has increased over the years, demonstrating that they are not being excluded from the university. 
Supreme Court Decision:
In June 2023, the Supreme Court ruled against race-conscious admissions policies, effectively banning affirmative action at colleges and universities. This decision, while not specifically addressing the Harvard case, has broader implications for higher education admissions practices, potentially impacting the representation of various racial groups.",0,2025-04-17T16:15:08Z

But #3 also consist of good and brave lawyers & law firms, including institutions that produce these elite lawyers from Havard Law aided by their Law professors. So, while he is nearing the full conclusion of his total control of the 3rd branch, this scary fact is hidden by the many 'major distractions"" thrown in along the way like tariffs and acting as a smoke screen as the nation's full focus is not on it. Once he can succeed in discrediting judges, top lawyers, law firms and prestigious Law Universities not forgetting State Attorney Generals and Prosecutors. His complete sweep of government is done and there is nothing else left to stop him, even for ruling for his 3rd term (that's why he said wait, he won't mention yet, as it is a work-in-progress).

"*It’s always a good idea to re-elect a guy who tried to overthrow the vote of the American citizens by masterminding a deadly insurrection at the capital because he didn’t like the outcome of the election. A leader who’s a 34 count convicted felon, adjudicated sexual predator, six time bankrupted business man, who cheated on his taxes & stole top secret government classified documents. 

Not to mention, a pathological liar, malignant narcissist, who’s on his third marriage, & refuses to release his tax receipts, medical records, college transcripts. 

Oh! … & who wears a comb-over, spray tan, diapers, & smells Vile! A guy who has cheated his entire life, never paid rent or a mortgage & who craps in gold plated toilets.

Trump is rated the Worst President in History by multiple sources, yet America has voted him back in office so he can earn that title Twice in a row. I’m wondering how this is going to make America great again ?
I can’t see a future for the rule of law !

"​The issue is in the DEI frameworks themselves.
The goal is often to increase representation of certain ethnicities or genders to meet targets or “balance” demographics.
That means race and sex are not just background details – they become factors in the decision-making, alongside or even above merit.
If the goal was only to hire or admit the best individuals, identity wouldn’t need to be part of the process.
So by definition, DEI shifts focus from individual qualifications to group identity.
That’s the problem. It’s not inclusion when someone is left out for not being the “right” sex or ethnicity.",1,2025-04-15T23:04:42Z

"As a disabled engineer I have seen no value in any of the supposed research done by Harvard to date for the disabled community and people that suffer from muscle diseases so maybe they can share what they have done and given the disabled community in leu of their research funds. Those funds per my understanding have been bloated by 50-60% for massive overhead allowing little for research while not showing any results for many years which has done great harm to the disabled community in general. The disabled community is estimated at 16% of the worlds population or 1.3 billion worldwide.  Based on their performance to date in this arena in the coming world of AI, Harvard will all be rendered a useless entity. I would love to be wrong and they secretly have come up with the answers to many disabilities and maybe their hiding it for some reason. What many in the disabled community do not understand is if those Harvard funds(and the other institutions receiving these massive grants) had been directed to the proper sources that actually do preform in research many in the disabled community would be walking or having a much better life now. Is it just incompetence by Harvard or are they slow rolling the cures/mobility devices keeping hundreds of millions immobile or in wheelchairs???  I think even people at CNN have members of family or friends that have disabilities so they might understand the questions I have raised and maybe start asking the tough questions.  Many of the Harvard lawyers would have a tough time on hearing with me as I know the answers they don't and that's why AI will never replace me.  Z",0,2025-04-15T22:30:31Z

"Trump is strategically targeting America’s elite universities, using the powerful and politically charged banner of “anti-Semitism” to pressure them into compliance with his agenda. Despite these institutions being among the most liberal forces in the country, he’s managed to strike a sensitive nerve. He understands the influence of the Ashkenazi elite in American power structures, and their deep anxiety over the rising tide of student-led opposition to Israel’s policies—policies increasingly seen as genocidal, rooted in ethnic cleansing, and built on the subjugation of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.

This elite now finds itself caught in a painful contradiction: on one hand, they want to uphold liberal values and freedoms in American society; on the other, they are deeply invested—emotionally, politically, and ideologically—in the survival of Israel as a colonial and apartheid state. Faced with this growing crisis, some are being pulled toward Trump, not because they share his broader politics, but because they see him as a blunt instrument to suppress a movement they fear is spiraling beyond their control.",0,2025-04-15T20:54:26Z

    This reminds me clearly of the deportation of Jews, Gypsies, political prisoners, as well as captured enemy soldiers by Germany under Hitler as a result of which MILLIONS were removed from western Europe, and sent to lands administered as captured territories to suffer mass execution or be enslaved, and worked to death while being fed sawdust for bread. None of this is ok, and in fact will end in the destruction of the United States as a criminal state by those nations which maintain their sanity, and who will be forced by their people to carry forth trials, and hangings of any of it's surviving leaders.
    Trump, Miller, and Bondi are trying to normalize the sending of political prisoners such as judges, and reporters, and anyone they wish to places where our laws do not apply such that they may be permanently disappeared. This is all intended to both carry out these acts as well as terrorize the citizens that may argue against them.
    Once before under Republicans George Bush had his Attorney General Alberto Gonzales ""study"" if torturing rendered prisoners in third world black sites was legal, and indeed that is what was decided, normalized, and done to citizens of other countries based solely upon verbal accusation, and without due process.

He fired all the JAG lawyers who would and could go after military leaders who did not follow their oath
He is actively defying the courts and said the judges who rule against him should be removed.
He is going after Universities who teach things he doesn't like, who hire people he does not like and who criticize thin skinned groups.
He illegally disappeared people in the US to a foreign country without any due process, and is now talking about doing the same to ""home growns"" and just asked the dictator from El Salvador to build 5 more supermax prisons for Americans.

He is going after media who say things he does not like (the AP would not call the Gulf of Mexico something else), and suing major news outlets and newpapers who write things he does not like.

He has installed a loyalist in the DOJ and is doing exactly what he has accused other of doing (who weren't doing it)--he's weaponized the DOJ to use them as his own personal legal attack dogs.

"I find it interesting that an elite ivy league university one of the top 8 is getting this type of treatment. You have to be a very wealthy or super smart person to get into this school. 
I find it fascinating that trying to impede on this school with any DEI situation is absolutely ridiculous. 
I want to know as the % of students who get accepted into Harvard are of wealthy family’s. 
What is the goal here?
Is Drumpf and his cabinet trying to extort money from these rich foreign families?
If he gets to them first with his gold Visa card he then becomes the federal bank and they just give him money directly so he can line his pockets and not the very expensive well off Universities.

All I know is Drumpf is cooking something sinister and I hope the American people are wise to it, the time will come to vote and let’s just hope Americans want to end citizens united, they want free higher education, universal basic income, universal healthcare, lower cost of living, better wages and better public transportation. Everyone deserves a chance at a pathway to citizenship be it they are rich or poor.

We just need to make it a fair playing field so when times like these spring up many will be confused if helping an Ivy League school gain more grant money with 67% of the attending are of wealthy families , is indeed going to help in the long run?

I stand for everyone as they deserve the right to a higher education and the right to citizenship but I do draw a line when we are not getting any help from large universities that stop low income families the ability of higher learning as these types of universities make it difficult to compete when they have so much capital from wealthy alumni.

I got you Harvard but let’s hope you stand for low income families that want their poor American smart children to get into that Ivy League school you lift a hand and lift that % of low income families get into that nice beautiful school of yours.

I stand for the rights of people and we got nothing but time to figure out this DEI situation and that of expensive universities helping the staggering number of students the ability to say they got a degree at a top 8 school in the US.

School is a right not a luxury.
A path way to citizenship should be simple and painless.
Everyone deserves to see America as a place of prosperity even the little kid in the ghetto hoping one day they can have enough money to go out and eat and have a degree from a good school that can help lift them up into a prosperous career and a better life.

We as citizens have finally reached a point that we will have to multitask a whole plethora of problems and challenges that plague this country, one big one being Drumpf and his entire cabinet.

If I, as the mayor of New Paltz New York, am in  charge of a government that unethically gives money to Jango's Smoothie shop, is the ethical move to withhold that improper funding until they get rid of certain flavors and after they adjust their menu, they get their money back?

Not too mention they're counter productive (promoting fighting discrimination with more discrimination).   Those policies defy basic logic and reason and discredit prestigious universities like Harvard.  Not too mention they're polarizing and divisive, solve nothing in practice and only serve to cause additional social unrest (which is approaching breaking point in America).  And of course they're a total waste of both taxpayer's and private contributors money to university funding.  Also, such policies are being massively rejected by a majority of Americans, from all backgrounds.  Universities have refused to acknowledge this fact and keep pushing their agenda through people's throat because they believe they're part of an elite who ""know better"".

The anti-semitism rhetoric is Israel telling Trump look we got you to the Presidency you've got to squash the 1st amendment of free speech and free open protest (assembly). College Students come together from all over the world and at the college and university level of education....most students aren't racist and our open to each other and to new friendships and connections. Kids move out from High School for the first time and they meet kids/students from different and diverse backgrounds and they learn that there's nothing to fear from meeting new ways of being or thinking. This is the power and beauty of College Universities...and Putin, Trump and AIPAC/Israel....want complete power .  When will American Politicians STOP taking Money from Israel. When will they ban together like Harvard must do with all Universities and Colleges across the country and the world...its the same thing with the Politicians .....Will the Corey Booker's of the world stop taking money from Israel....will they ban together with other politicians and stand up for Universities and not just that but for our 1st amendment rights...RIGHT to Free Speech and Right to Assemble....We are at a turning point......and we must ban together...if not they will pick us off one by one.

It also suggested freezing access to grants and contracts in order to crack down on institutions that didn’t comply. (Project 2025 was published before the Israel-Hamas war began in 2023 and has little to say about the rise in reports of antisemitism on college campuses or how to hold colleges accountable.)

"For context, I am a 56 years old white man, and no, I don't recognize my ""privilege"" here, just giving you context.  I am against D.E.I. for it's fundamental values, NOT the face values, or if you will, the values put upfront. Meaning I'm all for equality of opporunity, for diversity, not only in regards to sex/gender/race related issues, but primarily diversity of opinion. As for inclusion, how can you be for diversity and not for inclusion?  I am a teacher, and yes, I confirm, D.E.I. is an ideology, not science, and this is where my objections most strongly stem from.  The D.E.I. structure relies on mainly five pilars, race/sexual orientation/gender/feminism/colonialism (patriarchy).  The way, the humanities treat these subjects does NOT, by DESIGN, respect the scientific method.  That's my major problem: it discredits one of the most important institutions of democracy namely science.  It has become not a movement for human rights or for the advancement of human rights, but an anti male mouvement.  This being said, The Trumpist way to tackling this problem is the worst possible: the fascist way.  We'll get no results out of this except giving arguments to the ultra feminist crowd.  This should be done by imposing a clear framework for each university to respect when doing research.  This framework should be designed, maintened and overseen by professors, not any bureaucrat.  Change the institution, yes, but respecting it and what values of society it represents.  It should not be managed and/or overviewed by any other than the real experts, here, the professors.

Never in a million years would Harvard except a moral degenerate like Donald Trump! He only got into Wharton through his older brother! They took one look at him and would never except someone with low high school grades! In the end Donald thanked his brother by demeaning him and forcing him into the family business which he wanted nothing to do with! In the end he died young of alcohol abuse!

"OK...while I applaud Harvard for standing up to the Orange Emperor, the tone of the reporting again, CNN, reeks of ""Champagne Liberal"".  I know that as I am watching this, the first thing I am thinking is: why does Harvard get (or need) $2.2 billion in public money?  And if I am thinking it, so are a lot of others.  

It has a $30 billion endowment, the largest of any academic institution in the US (and probably the reason it can defy this order), and an enrollment of a very elite 25k individuals - about 60% the amount of a state university like UGA or University of Alabama (both averaging around 40-45k students).  

No state university has the endowment money Harvard does, and they receive the same or less in funding - so what gives?  And we all *know* our local community colleges and smaller 4-year colleges aren't seeing any of that money, because they are getting it from the students, or rather from the loans that are piled onto the backs of the students.  Which brings up the issue that a non-zero amount of those attending Harvard - which again, receives a $2.2 billion grant yearly from the government - will graduate with a crippling student loan debt, which they racked up while attending an institution that was accepting grant money paid for by their tax dollars. 

All of this is to say, that as a person who is college educated and interacts on a regular basis with people who are not, I can tell you that from their perspective this $2.2 billion is practically piled up and set on fire every year for all they care.  When you do these spots, you need to do a little better job of explaining *why* Harvard needs or should get $2.2 billion in federal money, because this is how the Propagandists on the RIght and the Authoritarians win.",0,2025-04-15T15:31:22Z

Democrats have passed up the opportunity many times to hold corporations responsible when those companies receive billions in subsidies while engaging in unethical, oppressive, destructive practices. Dems say they stand for equality and human rights, yet when they have the Presidency and a majority of Congress, they pass up opportunity after opportunity to do something about it because they're afraid to upset Republicans and their rich donors.

"My daughter attended the HNMUN: Harvard National Model United Nations conference in february representing Utrecht University Model United Nations, the Dutch deligation. HNMUN serves as a forum in which students from colleges and universities around the world can meet to discuss the greatest challenges facing the world today, in fields ranging from international peace and security to economic and social progress and human rights. In this spirit, the goal of HNMUN is to begin a process whereby constructive debate today can lead to solutions tomorrow. HNMUN is the oldest, largest, and most prestigious Model UN conference of its kind. Harvard leads the rest of the world by example.
People that attend this conference are carefully selected in their own country as a delegate; in the Netherlands only around 10% of all applicants is selected to be a delegate. The students from all over the world that attend most of the time end up in high positions in government, UN etc.

Simply stated if you run a debt where you are spending more money than what you make. And you can no longer pay your debt. The only thing you can do when your boxed in is to file bankruptcy. I can't get any more black and white. We have a 36 trillion dollar debt. We the USA can no longer sustain debt payments. Do you really believe DOGE is stealing money? If the Government cannot bring in capital. And all the billionaires where to have all their money taken from the. It would not put a dent in the 36T debt. Someone has to do it. Trump didn't put us here. Democrats have bern in office running the country 12 out of 16 years. They ran the country into debt. And some how Trump did it. That's what you been told by the media. Really? Trump did it. Crazy. So if Trump doesn't bring in money. How do we remove 37T in debt? Are you going to pay more taxes to reduce the debt. What to hear who on the left is going to take 50% of uour income give it yo the government so we can continue to live in America. Anyone out there ready to do this? F No! So Trump is reversing the debt, so you don't  have to pay. Putting it on the backs of countries. If we don't grow the GDP. Put people back to work, sell our engery, financialreduce our debt.

"Project 2025 in action. Trump and his Republicans are doing exactly what they said they’d do when Trump was back in the White House. The US is now an authoritarian state where the rule of law means Trump’s law. No question about that. The real question is whether Americans will care enough about it and feel impacted enough that they’ll do something more than the occasional sign-waving and chanting. Unlike the American Revolution and Civil War, when both sides were armed and aiming to settle matters with bullets snd cannonballs, today’s bad guys have guns and a hunger to use them and people on the opposite side have good intentions and blind faith that democracy will hold just because, well, we’re America. Democracy is what we do. It’s not holding. It’s been shoved to the ground and trampled over like litter. Meanwhile, I have anti-Trump, liberal-voting friends who feel too stressed by politics and choose to focus 100% on their summer travels, dinner parties with like-minded friends and living their best willfully oblivious lives. It’s past time for massive strikes of workers across all business sectors, sit-ins and building occupations, traffic jams, resistance of all nonviolent sorts at every level of both the private and public sectors. I may be foolish to still hold out hope that some Republicans in Congress and the Supreme Court will change course and start resisting the Trump regime, but if that were to happen, it would come only after so many regular citizens rise up that their numbers and courage embolden every Republican who still has a salvageable moral compass buried somewhere in their MAGA-complicit cowardice and self-serving dishonesty.

GOP and the ones that voted for Trump are exactly like the people in Germany that made Nazi Germany possible.
Educate yourself on history and you will see that the history repeats itself here and the rest of America just sit still and let it happen.
Just like almost all Germans did in 1933.
Most Americans are pretending that it is not happening, just like most Germans did.
The main difference between USA of 2025 and Germany of 1933, is that the transition into a full blown fascist authoritarian regime, is going much faster in America than it did in Germany.

Americans thinking that the Constitution is going to protect them, are totally deluded and blind.

My biggest issue is while everyone is rightfully calling trump and his supporters out they are turning a blind eye to why he won in the first place.
Democrats basically not only alienateda large voter base, they didn't prpvide any overarching vision. That compared to trump who not only embraced the said alienated portion he is also a heck of a show man. Say what you will Kamala's campaign was weaker than even Hillary's and she had mega scandals on her plate. With Biden and Kamala democratic party just appeared to have either given up or deluded themselves into thinking any nominee with democrat would win.

Idk how we will bounce back from all the fascism and economic mess atm but nothing gonna get better until democratic party wakes the fuck up cleans house.

"I don't agree with the address to Harvard University. I don't agree with protests against a nation that was attacked as Israel was. Around 15 hundred people were needlessly murdered. Israel didn't respond to the attackers because Israel wasn't considering something like that happening. You start a fight and then get a fight and it is all you that is to blame. The Palestinians have suffered and still do suffer. Warning to this country that would not stand against people that would violate this country and what it stands for. The Palestinians suffer because to many allowed something that should not have been allowed. Fair is that if you allow people to violate your country and space, you are just as responsible. If you are being forced to comply with angry people that would damage you for their own self absorbed conditions, then standing into them is the only way. If you see all around you backing the wrongful approach then you are a victim that cannot do anything. If the Palestinian people would stand around knowing that something within their population was going to harm others not part of their population then they have a penalty to pay. You harm and murder without need or stand there watching it happen simply because you don't like something about those that are being harmed, you shall have to pay at some point also. The human condition is such in may cases. So those that don't have a fair minded approach do harm those around them and those that look the other way for reason that there is nothing they can do anyway, is that many of those that stand there are not fair minded either. You don't attack someone or stand there watching someone attack others that are not on your side of the fence and expect leniency. I would put it to you this way. How many would suggest to have leniency on Americans if somehow this country was invaded. Look at how the Russians treat Ukraine. Americans would be treated savagely and I know this. Just because of the nature of the beast. Being fair begets savagery against your person. Fair approaches civility: yet civility isn't a concern for those that would take without need. Murder is without need. If you murder then suggest someone be civil to you, what are you? A fool. If your country would damage another country and then suggest civility toward your citizens, you are a fool. Doesn't work that way. Warning to my fellow Americans also. You stand there and care not of what happens to others and then suggest someone treat you with civility, you shall be fooling yourselves also. Laws are to maintain order. Not to be dismissed because you are a president or someone that suggest he or she is special and not responsible or obligated in some way to promote order.",0,2025-04-15T12:28:26Z

"John Adams, the second President of the United States and a key Founding Father, offered a stark warning about the fragility of democracy. He wrote:

""Democracy will soon degenerate into an anarchy, such an anarchy that every man will do what is right in his own eyes, and no man's life or property or reputation or liberty will be secure. Every one of these will soon mould itself into a system of subordination of all the moral virtues and intellectual abilities, all the powers of wealth, beauty, wit, and science, to the wanton pleasures, the capricious will, and the execrable cruelty of one or a very few.""

Adams believed that unchecked democracy could quickly spiral into chaos, ultimately paving the way for tyranny by a small group or even a single ruler. His words serve as a reminder of the importance of strong institutions, the rule of law, and civic virtue to safeguard liberty and prevent the concentration of power. This perspective remains relevant in evaluating any administration, including the Trump administration, as it underscores the ongoing need for vigilance against the erosion of democratic norms and protections.",1,2025-04-15T12:12:21Z

They are attacking the Constitution, Free Speech, America's universities, advocating for the deportation of students who protested against war crimes. In fact. If you study how Israel controls the lives of the Palestinians, you will discover that methodology is now operating in plain sight through the Trump Administration. I'm telling Americans to really take a deep look at Bill Ackman and Betar to get a really clear understanding of their real agenda and perhaps to see the very dark future America faces if America no longer abides by the Constitution, democracy, diversity, education, unity, the rule of law, and civil liberties. 😮",0,2025-04-15T11:53:06Z
