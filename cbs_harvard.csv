"If the Case of Harvard vs the King of the USA is unsuccessful, the university might have to consider their options.  It seems like those that landed in America centuries ago,  Harvard could have to search for a new land where freedom of thoughts and beliefs are not dictated by one man and his supporters.   I believe Canada has some beautiful locations that would easily support a very large campus.  If Harvard was willing to accept a flat rural location,  Canada might even throw in the  Montréal–Mirabel International Airport as part of the campus.  It is the start of America's Dark Age and having citizen's who are smarter than the King cannot be allowed. The entire education system is under attack to service the ego of the King, his lords, and their foot soldiers.",0,2025-04-28T16:04:35Z

"Funding these colleges that have tens of millions of dollars in their endowments, needs to be either eliminated or reduced substantially, until our national debt is zero. They can fund a lot of these projects themselves by reducing expenses, eliminating senseless majors that nobody is going to get a job with, reduce what they pay their professors, and graduate assistants and spend more of donations from their alumni for these projects. They can also ask private industry for donations, as that’s usually part of their corporate policy.",1,2025-04-15T04:50:11Z

Redirect those funds to local community colleges—where real impact happens, and a greater number of students can benefit. The world is shifting rapidly, and so is education. Today, academic knowledge fits in the palm of your hand, and edutainment is emerging as a powerful force—delivering massive amounts of information in engaging ways.

What we need now is investment in grassroots talent. Equip gifted students from community colleges—often overlooked yet brimming with potential. It’s time to stop feeding the machine of elite private institutions that thrive on student debt and serve only a narrow slice of the population.

No university should receive ANY tax money!!!!!,10,2025-04-15T03:23:57Z
Private colleges dont need ANY government money anyway.  All these ivy league school's have BILLION dollar endowment's. let the companies who benefit by the research by overcharging the public on breakthrough's pay for it.,2,2025-04-15T03:23:55Z
"Again,  the news channel and everyone keeps misswording what the president said.  He did not say that.  I hope people do their research.   These universities only carded about one side and favored one side.  They allowed students to be attacked, and all the president is saying is that if you do not control and discipline students, that attack others students, then you will get no money.   As a Latino, I even see the truth.",0,2025-04-15T03:23:52Z
